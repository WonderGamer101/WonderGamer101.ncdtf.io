        "Hey!"<br>
        You hear a voice coming from all around you.<br>
        You look around, but there's nothing to be seen.<br>
        Nothing but a dark and empty room, save for its wooden floorboards, old sofa, and a lone TV that plays nothing but static.<br>
        It's the only thing illuminating the dark as of now.<br>
        "What're you standing around for?! C'mon, sit down!"<br>
        With not many options, you oblige, fabric creaking as you put your weight on it.<br>
        "...Hey, you alright? You're looking a little out of it."<br>
        The voice's tone shifts into one of concern.<br>
        "You...do know what's going on right? Do you recognize me?"<br>
