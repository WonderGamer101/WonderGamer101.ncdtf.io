    <p class="ass-talk" style="font-size: large;"><strong><i>"Daigo!!"</i></strong></p>
    <p class="ass-talk">"Waaah!"</p>
    <p>A rabbitboy snaps awake, flailing upright and almost falling back on gentle softness.</p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">"I'm awake, I'm awake...!"</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">
    <p class="ass-status"><b>Daigo (Robin, Skin 7), He/Him, Co-Host</b>
        <br>“In For a Rude Awakening”
        <br>Status: He's Awake
    </p>

    <p class="ass-text">He rubs the sleep out of his eyes, still getting adjusted to the brightness of the room,
        still dealing with the dazedness of waking up so suddenly.</p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">"Huh...? Wha...?"</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="ass-talk">"Finally. I was wondering if you'd ever wake up."</p>

    <p class="ass-text">With his eyes still adjusting, he looks up to the source of the voice. An all-too-familiar one.</p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">"I understand if you're tired, but now is certainly not the time for a nap."</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/tera.png">
    <p class="ass-status"><b>Tera (Sheik, Skin 8), He/It, Host</b>
        <br>“Daigo's Better Half”
        <br>Status: Busy Busy Busy
    </p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">"Where...am I?"</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="ass-talk-text">"Where else? You're in the stadium."</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/tera.png">

    <p class="ass-text">Sure enough, as he looks around, Daigo finds himself in one of the green rooms of the <span style="font-style: normal;">All Systems Struggle</span> stadium. 
        He's sitting on one of its couches, deep inside and rather comfortable, almost making his own groove into it.<br><br>
    
        But instead of comfort, all he currently feels is confusion.<br><br>

        He doesn't remember ever sitting on this couch. He doesn't remember anything before then. It's all just...blank.</p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">"How did I get here...? How long was I out?"</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="ass-talk-text">"The same way you always do: through the door. Now come along, it's almost time to go."</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/tera.png">

    <p class="ass-talk-text">"Go where?"</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="ass-talk-text">"The arena! Have you forgotten that we're having a special tournament today?"</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/tera.png">

    <p class="ass-text">A special tournament...?</p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">"I... I guess I did? I might be a little lost."</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="ass-text">Tera sighs in that exasperated parent kind of way.</p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">"Come. I'll catch you up to speed."</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/tera.png">

    <p class="ass-text">Tera reaches a hand out.<br><br>
    
        Daigo hesitates for a moment, but... Tera would totally know what's going on.<br><br>

        And he grabs onto the hand, reaching out with one of his own, soon to be lifted up to his feet.<br><br>
    
        ...<br><br>

        Daigo follows closely behind Tera as they both wander the halls through the ASS Stadium.<br><br>

        Every so often, Daigo would catch a glimpse of the things around him as he walks. After all, with ADHD, that tends to happen.
        Everything seems so normal at first glance. Like, yep, it's the stadium, just like he remembers it. 
    </p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">"Now, we've been reaching out to other organizations that host their own tournaments around the country.
        'Fuffles,' I believe they were called..."</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/tera.png">

    <p class="ass-talk-text">"Y-Yeah, that's the term..."</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="ass-text">And yet, whenever Daigo tries to focus on something, it's...different.<br><br>

        Text is jumbled and unreadable. Places that usually take longer to get to are quicker. Turns and twists that shouldn't be there 
        at all are suddenly built into the stadium.<br><br>
        
        It's like the stadium, but it's not <span style="font-style: normal;">exactly</span> the stadium.<br><br>
        
        Like a memory of it.
    </p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">"I've spoken to one of the showrunners of a certain fuffle, and they've agreed to have a special little event
        that I believe we can all enjoy."</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/tera.png">

    <p class="ass-text">They turn the corner, pausing a few steps before the exit leading out to the arena as Tera turns to face his co-host.</p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">"You've heard of <i>CPU Kerfuffle,</i> yes?"</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/tera.png">

    <p class="ass-text">...<br><br>

        Daigo's eyes light up with childlike wonder as he gasps. He starts to flap his arms as an overjoyed squeal leaks out of his mouth,
        bouncing in place.
    </p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">"You seem rather excited over the name."</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/tera.png">

    <p class="ass-talk-text">"Well, of course I'm excited!! It's <i>CPU Kerfuffle!</i> It's the whole reason why I wanted to start this
    whole bloodsports stuff in the first place! How could I <i>not</i> be excited?!"</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="ass-text">He can see Tera grin from under his mask.</p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">"Then you're going to love this."</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/tera.png">

    <p class="ass-text">Another gasp from Daigo, as it's slowly dawning on him what's going on.</p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">"You didn't actually...!"</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="ass-text">A chuckle from Tera.</p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">"Why don't we find out together?"</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/tera.png">

    <p class="ass-text">The two hosts step out of the hallway and into the outdoors, the sunlight almost blinding Daigo.<br><br>

        As his vision clears, he can see this explosive crowd, full stadium, electric and loud as they cheer and holler. A lot 
        of them are holding up signs and banners representing many fighters from what's probably CPU Kerfuffle.<br><br>

        A woman in red with white hair holding an axe, a cyborg-looking fellow with a burning blade, an actual child with pigtails
        and a man both leaping up for an uppercut, several men with rather large tits, three sharply colored entities beyond his
        comprehension, hued in cobalt, chartreuse, and crimson... Just to name a few.<br><br>

        But that doesn't mean that there isn't just as much support for ASS. Signs and banners of John Justice, Mike the Uber Jobber, 
        the Bladeburst Duo, Banana, Hibachi, Lacey...<br><br>

        All fighters that Daigo recognizes on both fronts.<br><br>

        The enthusiasm was infectious. Daigo is just as into it as everyone else. There's a massive smile on his face as he takes it all in.<br><br>

        That is, until his eyes looked slightly upwards, and towards the sky.
    </p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">"W-What the hell...?"</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="ass-text">The sky was...blue. And orange. And purple. And red and yellow and green. All the colors of the rainbow, 
        all swirling together, like tie dye that's long since faded or gasoline on a particularly wet road.<br><br>

        And it's hard to see this other thing, but… Daigo could swear that he saw the sun shining in the same colors of the sky, 
        only a lot more saturated and eyestraining.<br><br>
        
        This is not normal.<br><br>
        
        This is <span style="font-style: normal;">definitely</span> not normal.
    </p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">"<i>W-What the hell is going on with this place...?</i>"</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="ass-text">The audio speakers around the stadium echo with Tera's voice as it speaks into the microphone it's holding.</p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">"Ladies and gentlemen and those beyond the binary! Welcome...to the Dream Tourney Festival!!"</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/tera.png">

    <p class="ass-text">The crowd explodes.</p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">"I am your gracious host, ever so excited to be here with you all, Tera!"</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/tera.png">

    <p class="ass-text">He passes the mic to Daigo, who's a lot more distracted.</p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">"Huh? O-Oh, shit, yeah...! A-A-And I'm Daigo, I'm your co-host...!"</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="ass-talk-text">"Please excuse my other half here. He's a bit lost in the intensity of this event."</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/tera.png">

    <p class="ass-text">The stadium echoes with the laughter of the crowd.</p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">"We'd like to thank you all for coming, from the bottom of our hearts. The support and love you all have 
        for these shows is nothing short of breathtaking. We have an exciting day ahead of us planned, our way of showing gratitude to 
        you all! We have gathered many fighters from both <span style="font-style: italic;">All Systems Struggle</span> and 
            <span style="font-style: italic;">CPU Kerfuffle,</span> ready to duke it out! For glory, for supremacy, and for just 
            good old-fashioned fun!"</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/tera.png">

    <p class="ass-text">More cheering as Tera claps along with everyone.</p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">"And of course, this event would never have been possible if it wasn't for the help and generosity of our
        guest host."</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/tera.png">

    <p class="ass-text">Daigo does a double-take, confused.</p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">"W-Wait, hold on a sec, 'guest?' What do you—...?"</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="ass-talk-text">"Representing <span style="font-style: italic;">CPU Kerfuffle</span>, I give you... 
        <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Prism!"</span></strong></p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/tera.png">

    <p class="ass-text">...<br><br>

        Daigo's heart sinks into his stomach hearing that name.<br><br>
        
        He recognizes it.<br><br>

        He recognizes it all too well.<br><br>

        Tera's hand leads the crowd and Daigo's eyes to the entrance opposite from where the hosts came from.
    </p>

    <p class="cpuk-text">And out of that hallway, steps a woman.<br><br>

        A pale woman in pristine white, accented with the same rainbow as the sun.<br><br>
        
        Almost everything about her is rainbow. The skirt of her dress and the rims of her gloves and boots.
        The fringe locks and the tailend of her flowing hair, like several paintbrushes dipped in multiple layers of paint. 
        The headband that rests on her head, decorated with a little prism off to the side. The pearl necklace around her neck. Her piercing 
        and almost unblinking eyes.<br><br>
        
        All of this, as she wears a saccharine smile on her face, one so nauseatingly sweet.<br><br>

        The lady steps up onto the arena, pulling out a microphone of her own.
    </p>

    <p class="cpuk-talk-text">"Hi there, everyone~!"</p>
        <img class="cpuk-talk" src="../talksprites/cpuk/prism.png" style="width:28%;height:28%;margin-left:74%;">
