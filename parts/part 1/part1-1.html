        This is.<br><br>
        
        The fucking worst.<br><br>
        
        Daigo sincerely cannot believe this is happening right now, before his very eyes and rabbit ears.<br><br>

        On what was supposed to be the best tournament ever with one of his favorite shows of all time, this
        fucking white woman rears her head and comes up stage to ruin everything.<br><br>

        This fucking white woman named "Prism."
    </p>

    <p class="cpuk-text">She waves at the still cheering crowd, much to Daigo's dismay.</p>

    <p class="cpuk-talk-text">"Gosh, it's great to be up here with you guys! Seeing all these other tournament 
        shows pop up, all thanks to CPUK, made with so much love and care... It just warms my heart!"</p>
    <img class="cpuk-talk" src="../talksprites/cpuk/prism.png" style="width:28%;height:28%;margin-left:74%;">

    <p class="ass-talk-text">"The pleasure is all ours, it's lovely to have you here with us."</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/tera.png">

    <p class="cpuk-talk-text">"D'aww, you don't have to be like that, Tera! I'm just an ordinary gal who happens to be divine."</p>
    <img class="cpuk-talk" src="../talksprites/cpuk/prism.png" style="width:28%;height:28%;margin-left:74%;">

    <p class="cpuk-text">She titters.</p>

    <p class="ass-text">Something about that exchange makes Daigo sick to his stomach.</p>

    <p class="cpuk-talk-text">"Now, for those of you who don't know me… Hi, I'm Prism! I'm  the one in charge of <i>CPU Kerfuffle</i> now
        that we have our Grand Kerfuffle Tournament underway! Unfortunately, we're currently in a <i>teeeeensy</i> bit of a hiatus… But hey! What better way 
        to pass the time than with a crossover?"</p>
    <img class="cpuk-talk" src="../talksprites/cpuk/prism.png" style="width:28%;height:28%;margin-left:74%;">

    <p class="ass-talk-text">"That is true indeed, Prism. However, this will not be your typical tournament. A select roster of fighters from both
        <i>CPU Kerfuffle</i> and <i>All Systems Struggle</i> will duke it out! Fighters from each show will face each other, either chosen at random
        or by audience request! The usual rules apply: three stocks, eight minutes, no items, but done as a best of one!
        Winner takes all, and proves which show is superior!"</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/tera.png">

    <p class="cpuk-talk-text">"Now, now, Tera... This is all just for fun! Sure, everyone should give it their all, but we're not deciding which of us 
        is better."</p>
    <img class="cpuk-talk" src="../talksprites/cpuk/prism.png" style="width:28%;height:28%;margin-left:74%;">

    <p class="cpuk-text">She places a hand over her mouth, another giggle escaping her lips.</p>

    <p class="cpuk-talk-text">"It's totally gonna be us, though."</p>
    <img class="cpuk-talk" src="../talksprites/cpuk/prism.png" style="width:28%;height:28%;margin-left:74%;">

    <p class="ass-text">Tera chuckles along.</p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">"We'll just have to wait and see, then, won't we? Now, before we go and start our tournament, do either of you have any final 
        words to say?"</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/tera.png">

    <p class="ass-text">It holds the mic up to Daigo.</p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">"..."</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="ass-text">He sits there, in complete stunned silence, in utter disbelief.</p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">"...And what about you, Prism? Anything to add before we begin?"</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/tera.png">

    <p class="cpuk-talk-text">"Just that everyone should remember to get a good stretch in or two, don't overdo it, and—most importantly—have fun!"</p>
    <img class="cpuk-talk" src="../talksprites/cpuk/prism.png" style="width:28%;height:28%;margin-left:74%;">

    <p class="ass-talk-text">"Well said, well said. Now then! With all that said and done..."</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/tera.png">

    <br><br>

    <p class="ass-talk-text" style="text-align: center;">"Let's start the tourney!"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <span style="font-family: Nunito;">"Let's start the tourney!"</span><br>
        "..."</p>
    <img class="middle" src="../daigo+tera+prism.png">

    <p class="ass-text">As the crowd's cheers grow more and more deafening, Daigo still hasn't really moved an inch since Prism showed up.
        He's just been staring at her.<br><br>

        It's just...<br><br>
        
        Jesus Christ.<br><br>
        
        Why is this happening? Why is she here? Is this all some kind of fucked up joke at his expense? Is this a punishment?
    </p>

    <p class="cpuk-text">And of course, she happens to take a bit of notice.</p>

    <p class="cpuk-talk-text">"You okay there, Daigo? You're looking a little shell-shocked."</p>
    <img class="cpuk-talk" src="../talksprites/cpuk/prism.png" style="width:28%;height:28%;margin-left:74%;">

    <p class="ass-talk-text">"..."</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="ass-text">No response. He's just breathing through his teeth, trembling ever so slightly now that he's in her sights. 
        "Shell-shocked" doesn't even begin to describe what he's feeling.
    </p>

    <p class="cpuk-text">There's a slight hint of a frown that infects her smile, but only for just a moment.</p>

    <p class="cpuk-talk-text">"Aww, c'mon, you don't have to be like that... We're all friends here!"</p>
    <img class="cpuk-talk" src="../talksprites/cpuk/prism.png" style="width:28%;height:28%;margin-left:74%;">

    <p class="cpuk-text">She reaches out for a handshake.</p>

    <p class="cpuk-talk-text">"Why don't we get things off on the right fo—?"</p>
    <img class="cpuk-talk" src="../talksprites/cpuk/prism.png" style="width:28%;height:28%;margin-left:74%;">

    <p class="ass-talk-text">"G-Get your fucking hands away from me...!"</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="ass-text">Daigo instinctively slaps Prism's hand away as if she was holding him at knifepoint.</p>

    <p class="cpuk-text">Prism's stunned as she leaves her hand floating in place after the smack.</p>

    <p class="ass-text">Tera's stunned as he hears Daigo scream with terrified fury.<br><br>
    
        The whole crowd's stunned, their loud cheers turning into confused murmurs.<br><br>

        And Daigo's just quaking during it all.
    </p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">"Daigo, are... Are you alright?"</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/tera.png">

    <p class="ass-text">He turns to Tera, still with that fear in his eyes, trying to calm his breathing and failing.<br><br>
         
        All he can do is look away.</p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">"I... I need a minute..."</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="ass-text">And he bolts off towards a hallway. Any of them.</p>

    <p class="cpuk-talk-text">"Hey, where're—?"</p>
    <img class="cpuk-talk" src="../talksprites/cpuk/prism.png" style="width:28%;height:28%;margin-left:74%;">

    <p class="ass-talk-text">"Daigo, wait...!"</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/tera.png">

    <p class="ass-text">As far away from this white woman as he can.<br><br></p>
