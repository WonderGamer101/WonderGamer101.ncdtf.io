    <p class="ass-text">Daigo hides in one of the many locker rooms of the ASS Stadium, thankfully one that's empty... If you could even say that 
        it is... There's still so much weird stuff going on with the layout of this place. It's just not the same.<br><br>

        But that's not the problem right now, is it?<br><br>
        
        He sits on a bench, hunched over and hands over his head. His breathing's so quick and panicked. He's clawing at his head, trying really
        hard not to tear his hair out, or even his own ears.<br><br>
        
        This whole thing is a fucking nightmare.<br><br>

        This should've been the best tournament ever. A fucking dream.<br><br>

        And <span style="font-style: normal;">she's</span> here.<br><br>

        She's bound to ruin this somehow. She's probably going to kill someone if they rub her the wrong way.<br><br>

        What if it's one of CPUK's fighters? What if it's one of ASS's?<br><br>

        ...What if it's Tera?<br><br>

        Just the thought almost sends him into even more of a panic.<br><br>

        Thankfully, that train of thought is cut off as he hears a voice.
    </p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">"There you are."</p>

    <p class="ass-text">And he turns to see Tera approaching him with a gentle look in its eyes.</p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">"I've been looking everywhere for you. I was worried after what happened out in the field."</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/tera.png">

    <p class="ass-text">Daigo should be feeling relieved right now...<br><br>

        But he just doesn't.<br><br>

        He stands up and faces it.
    </p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">"Tera. What the fuck is she doing here?"</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="ass-talk-text">"I'm...not sure what you mean."</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/tera.png">

    <p class="ass-talk-text">"What. The fuck. Is Prism doing here?! <strong><i>WHY</i></strong> is she here?!"</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="ass-talk-text">"Well, she is our guest host. She's the one who came up to me with the idea of this tourney and—"</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/tera.png">

    <p class="ass-talk-text">"And you just fucking <i>went</i> with it?! I told you how she's bad fucking news, dude!"</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="ass-text">Tera sighs.</p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">"Now, Daigo, I understand that. But she is the host of <i>CPU Kerfuf</i>—"</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/tera.png">

    <p class="ass-talk-text">"No! No, she's not!! Iggy is! Iggy Koopa!! He's the god you should've talked to and
        brought over!! Prism even said so herself, she literally took over when the Grand Kerfuffle started!"</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">




    <p class="ass-talk-text">"I..."</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="ass-talk-text">"I can't. I'm sorry."</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">



    <p class="ass-talk-text">"And I really appreciate it, man. I just..."</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">



    <p class="ass-talk-text">"I'm scared of her. I'm scared of what she'll do."</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="ass-text">He starts to move to the door, head lowered, ears floppy, and mood ruined. And he pushes it open.<br><br>

        Before he does, he turns his head to face Tera, yet he doesn't want to look at him.
    </p>
    
    <p class="ass-talk-text">"Look, I'll just...watch the tourney from HQ. I don't wanna be anywhere near her..."</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="ass-text">And he turns back...</p>

    <p class="cpuk-talk-text">"Hey there, Daigo."</p>
    <img class="cpuk-talk" src="../talksprites/cpuk/prism.png" style="width:28%;height:28%;margin-left:74%;">

    <p class="ass-talk-text">"<strong><i>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!</i></strong>"</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <!--a scream of pure genuine terror-->

    <p class="ass-text">Prism is right in front of him, waving and still smiling.<br><br>
    
    He tries to run away, only to trip and fall on his ass. But that still doesn't stop him from trying to crawl away.
    </p>

    <!--Daigo scrambles for his sword, it's not working, he stands up & uses it as a blade-->

    <!--While charging the gun, Tera gets in Daigo's way; Daigo tells him to get out of the way because he refuses to give her a chance;
        eventually he puts his gun down to not hurt tera-->


    <!--maybe someone comes in to check up on all the screaming, sees the three of them, and immediately backs away-->
    

    <!--Tera mentions that if she's always telling the truth, then she's genuinely sorry; Daigo says something like
        "Oh yeah, like being sorry would stop her."-->

    <!--Daigo begs Tera to try to understand, even if he doesn't have the same context Daigo does-->

    <!--Tera brings up the fact that Daigo never seemed this angry before, ever; he does have a point-->

    <!--While he & Tera had many arguments, Daigo is putting his foot down refuses to let anyone else in ASS or in CPUK get hurt
        because of her-->
