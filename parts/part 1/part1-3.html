    <p class="ass-talk-text">“<span style="font-size: small; font-style: italic;">This isn’t happening, this isn’t happening, this isn’t happening,
        this isn’t happening, this isn’t happening...</span>”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="ass-text">Daigo hides in one of the many locker rooms of the ASS Stadium, thankfully one that’s empty... Though, it still doesn’t
        change the fact that there’s still so much weird stuff going on with the layout of this place. Lockers are in places where they aren't supposed to be in,
        the shades of color are different enough to be noticeable but not enough to notice at first glance... Everything’s just ever so
        slightly off in a way that feels uncomfortable.<br><br>
        
        It’s just not the same. There’'s no other way to put it.<br><br>

        But that’s not the problem right now, is it?<br><br>
        
        He sits on a bench, hunched over and hands over his head. His breathing’s so quick and panicked. He’s clawing at his head, trying really
        hard not to tear his hair out, or even his own ears.<br><br>
        
        This whole thing has been a fucking nightmare.<br><br>

        This should’ve been the best tournament ever. The dream tournament where he can fanboy out and talk with the CPUK roster,
        where his own fighters from ASS can meet them and understand why CPUK’s so important to Daigo.<br><br>

        But it’s not.<br><br>

        Because <span style="font-style: normal;">she’s</span> here.<br><br>

        She’s going to ruin this somehow. She’s probably going to kill someone if they rub her the wrong way. Hell, she might even kill them
        if they look at her wrong.<br><br>

        What if it’s one of CPUK’s fighters again? What if it’s one of ASS’s this time around?<br><br>

        ...What if it’s Tera?<br><br>

        Just the thought almost sends him into even more of a panic.<br><br>

        Thankfully, that train of thought is cut off as he hears a voice.<br><br>
        
        <span style="font-style: normal;">“There you are.”</span><br><br>
        
        And he turns to see Tera approaching him with a gentle look in its eyes.
    </p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“I’ve been looking everywhere for you. I was worried after what happened out in the field.”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/tera.png">

    <p class="ass-text">Daigo should be feeling relieved right now...<br><br>

        But he just doesn’t.<br><br>

        He steels himself, stands up, and faces it.
    </p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“Tera. What the fuck is she doing here?”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="ass-text">Tera furrows its brows.</p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“I’m...not entirely sure what you mean.”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/tera.png">

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“What. The fuck. Is Prism doing here?! <strong><i>WHY</i></strong> is she here?!”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“Well, she is our guest host. She’s the one who came up to me with the idea of this tourney and—”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/tera.png">

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“And you just fucking <i>went</i> with it?! I told you about how she’s bad fucking news before, dude!
        I went on for <i>ages</i> about it!”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="ass-text">Tera sighs.</p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“Now, Daigo, I understand that. But she is the host of <i>CPU Kerfuf</i>—”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/tera.png">

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“No! No, she’s not! Iggy is! Iggy Koopa!! <i>He’s</i> the god you should’ve talked to and
        brought over!! Prism even said so herself, she literally took over when the Grand Kerfuffle started!”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“Daigo, I understand that you’re scared, but really, she doesn’t seem to be as fearsome as you say...”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/tera.png">

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“You really trust that fake-ass <i>smile</i> of hers?! Seriously?! Like, who fuckin’ knows what she’s thinking,
        man?! She’s probably plotting another fucking takeover or something! And for some reason, she chose <i>us!</i> And for what?!”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="ass-text">Daigo’s nails are so close to his mouth, he might just start biting them.</p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“What if she’s after the Drivers...?! What if she’s just like fuckin’ CybeleCorp....?!”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“<i>Daigo.</i>”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/tera.png">

    <p class="ass-text">Tera places a hand on Daigo’s shoulder, snapping him out of his trance once again.</p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“You need to calm down. Isn’t this tournament what you wanted for so long? Don’t you want to have fun
        like everyone else? Can’t you just...put her aside and not worry about her?”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/tera.png">

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“I...”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="ass-text">Tera does have a point. And Daigo was just thinking about it not too long ago. This is quite literally the tournament
        of his dreams. There’s no way that he could get another chance like this in his life. Maybe if he and Tera are lucky enough, sure, but...<br><br>

        ...
    </p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“I can’t. I’m sorry.”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="ass-text">It just doesn’t seem worth it.</p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“And I really appreciate it, man. I just...”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="ass-text">Not with Prism around.<br><br>

        He pulls himself away from his fellow host and friend, limply and weakly, as his breath still shudders with his head swimming in all
        these thoughts of <i>her.</i>   
    </p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“I’m scared of her. I’m scared of what she’ll do. To anyone. To you.”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“Daigo...”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/tera.png">

    <p class="ass-text">He starts to move past Tera and to the door, head lowered, ears floppy, and mood eternally ruined.
        And he pushes it open.<br><br>

        Before he does, he turns his head to face Tera, yet he doesn’t want to look at him. He wants to avoid its gaze.
    </p>
    
    <p class="ass-talk-text">“Look, I’ll just...watch the tourney from HQ. I don’t wanna be anywhere near her... Just promise me you’ll
        keep everyone safe and keep an eye out for any weird shit going on, alright...?”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="ass-text">And he turns back...</p>

    <p class="cpuk-talk-text">“Hey there, Daigo.”</p>
    <img class="cpuk-talk" src="../talksprites/cpuk/prism.png" style="width:28%;height:28%;margin-left:74%;">

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“<strong><i>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHH!!!</i></strong>”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="ass-text">He lets out a shriek of pure and genuine terror.</p>
        
    <p class="cpuk-text">Prism stands there right in front of him, waving.</p>

    <p class="ass-text">And still smiling that awful smile of hers. Just popped into existence like his own personal devil, come to torment him.<br><br>
    
        He tries to run away, only to trip and fall on his ass. But that still doesn’t stop him from trying to crawl away.
    </p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“<i>S-S-Stay back...!</i>”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="cpuk-talk-text">“Daigo, listen, I—”</p>
    <img class="cpuk-talk" src="../talksprites/cpuk/prism.png" style="width:28%;height:28%;margin-left:74%;">

    <p class="ass-text">He reaches for his sword, the “ChargeCalibur,” as he affectionately calls it, and draws it on her.</p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“<i>I said stay away from me!!</i>”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="ass-text">But his hold on it is shaky at best. His grip is tight, but from the sound of it, the blade keeps rattling in his
        hand. Almost like even the ChargeCalibur <span style="font-style: normal;">itself</span> is afraid of her.
    </p>

    <p class="cpuk-text">There’s a sadness to her eyes as she looks down at the sword, however.<br><br>
    
        She steps forward, ever so slightly, inch by inch...
    </p>

    <p class="cpuk-talk-text">“Daigo... I’m not here to hurt you or anyone else.”</p>
    <img class="cpuk-talk" src="../talksprites/cpuk/prism.png" style="width:28%;height:28%;margin-left:74%;">

    <p class="cpuk-text">Her voice is so...soft and gentle. It’s so weird to hear it.</p>
    
    <p class="ass-text">Even more unsettling for someone like Daigo.</p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“I-I don’t believe you...! W-What did you do to Tera?! Why is he going along with your plans?!”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="cpuk-talk-text">“I didn’t do anything at all. He can vouch for me, right, Tera?”</p>
    <img class="cpuk-talk" src="../talksprites/cpuk/prism.png" style="width:28%;height:28%;margin-left:74%;">

    <p class="ass-text">It nods.</p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“We were simply talking with each other, mostly about planning this sort of thing together.”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/tera.png">

    <p class="ass-text">Daigo doesn’t seem all that convinced. If anything, he’s shaking even more.</p>

    <p class="cpuk-talk-text">“I know you’re scared, but I’ve turned over a new leaf.”</p>
    <img class="cpuk-talk" src="../talksprites/cpuk/prism.png" style="width:28%;height:28%;margin-left:74%;">

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“W-W-Wha...?”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="cpuk-talk-text">“I’ve been through a lot, and I’ve done a lot of thinking since then...”</p>
    <img class="cpuk-talk" src="../talksprites/cpuk/prism.png" style="width:28%;height:28%;margin-left:74%;">

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“W-What’re you talking about...?</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="ass-text">He manages to stand up, keep the ChargeCalibur raised at Prism.</p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“What the hell do you mean you’'ve been through a lot...?!”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">
    
    <p class="cpuk-talk-text">“Oh, right... You...probably don’t know about the Non-Canon Curiosity Tournaments...”</p>
    <img class="cpuk-talk" src="../talksprites/cpuk/prism.png" style="width:28%;height:28%;margin-left:74%;">

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“‘Non-Canon Curi—...?’ What the fuck are you talking about?!”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="cpuk-text">She steps even closer now, moving past the blade.</p>

    <p class="cpuk-talk-text">“Here. Let me help.”</p>
    <img class="cpuk-talk" src="../talksprites/cpuk/prism.png" style="width:28%;height:28%;margin-left:74%;">

    <p class="cpuk-text">She reaches out a hand, two fingers outstretched and getting closer and closer to Daigo.</p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“H-Hey!! I told you to get away from—!”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="ass-text">He pulls an arm back, ready to swing his sword at her hand. But before he could even get the chance to...</p>

    <p class="cpuk-text">Tap.<br><br>

        Her fingertips poke Daigo’s forehead.<br><br>
        
        And in that very same instant, flashes of information start flooding his brain.<br><br>
        
        A lot of information.<br><br>
        
        Dreams, 64-person brackets, a hedgehog named Nelson, mashed potatoes, something about a script, the Lord of Snakes, car batteries, 
        Spectrum, Dantoinette kissing Crimson, self-actualization, the end of everything, stories, souls, Discord—
    </p>

    <p class="ass-text">With a long gasp, he pulls himself back and away from Prism, and falls to his knees, coughing up a storm as he
        clutches at his head, drowning in the flood of information. He heaves violently, feeling like he’s about to start throwing up and
        starting the coughing fit all over again.
    </p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“Daigo!”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/tera.png">

    <p class="ass-text">Tera rushes over to Daigo’s side to help his fellow host up on his feet, help keep his balance, as Daigo
        starts to speak in-between gasps.
    </p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“Wha...? W-What the fuck did you do to me...?”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="cpuk-talk-text">“I caught you up on everything about the NCCTs, up until the point I had to put it on hold. You should
        know what I’m talking about, right?”</p>
    <img class="cpuk-talk" src="../talksprites/cpuk/prism.png" style="width:28%;height:28%;margin-left:74%;">

    <p class="ass-text">As he slowly catches his breath, he starts to focus a little more. His head somehow feels more lucid yet still bloated,
        like a migraine that doesn’t really ache.<br><br>

        He feels like he can think a little straighter somehow with all these “memories” of tournaments he hadn’t heard of before, details and
        information he had never known while CPUK was airing, knowing it all as if he was actually there listening in.
    </p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“Y-Yeah... Yeah, I do.”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="cpuk-talk-text">“And you’re aware that you’re dreaming, right?”</p>
    <img class="cpuk-talk" src="../talksprites/cpuk/prism.png" style="width:28%;height:28%;margin-left:74%;">

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“I am now.”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="cpuk-talk-text">“Good... That’s good...”</p>
    <img class="cpuk-talk" src="../talksprites/cpuk/prism.png" style="width:28%;height:28%;margin-left:74%;">

    <p class="ass-text">Daigo remembers...so much about everything. The fights, the interactions, the happenings... Everything that's happened
        in these newly discovered “Non-Canon Curiosity Tournaments.”<br><br>
        
        Most of all, he can remember some things about Prism.<br><br>

        ...A lot of things, actually.
    </p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“Hold a minute, what do you mean by ‘dreaming’?”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/tera.png">

    <p class="cpuk-talk-text">“Just give us a sec, Tera... I’'ll explain in a little bit...”</p>
    <img class="cpuk-talk" src="../talksprites/cpuk/prism.png" style="width:28%;height:28%;margin-left:74%;">

    <p class="ass-text">...<br><br>
        
        Something inside of Daigo starts to boil.<br><br>

        In one instant, he could feel everything. He could feel all the fear of Prism leave his body. He could feel his heart pound faster
        and faster. He could feel his teeth grinding against each other. He could feel both of his fists ball up and tighten. He could feel
        the fur on his ears and tail bristling.<br><br>

        His whole body quakes, struggling to contain that something, to hold it back.<br><br>
    </p>

    <p class="cpuk-talk-text">“Now, I’m sure you have a lot of things to say and a lot of emotions to process… But I want you to know first and
        foremost that I’m not here for—”</p>
    <img class="cpuk-talk" src="../talksprites/cpuk/prism.png" style="width:28%;height:28%;margin-left:74%;">

    <p class="ass-text"><span style="font-weight: bolder; font-size: 103px;">SMAAAAAAASH!!!!</span><br>

        In that same instant, that something inside of him takes control of his body and wastes no time in turning on his heels and punching Prism square in the
        face with all the might he can muster, his fist smushing and grinding deep against her nose and lips. He manages to make her trip and stumble back, as
        her back slams against the wall behind her.<br><br>

        It was a sloppy hit. His angle was off and he’s pretty sure he twisted his wrist a little with that.<br><br>

        But to him, that doesn’t even matter right now.
    </p>

    <p class="cpuk-text">She looks up at the co-host of ASS, somehow still smiling as she shakily cups her nose with a hand, wiping away a bit
        of what looks like multicolored…sparkles? Blood? Hard to tell.<br><br>

        She grunts the words out through the pain, albeit a little nasally, as she shambles and slides up to her feet.        
    </p>

    <p class="cpuk-talk-text">“Y-Yeah... I guess that’s a reasonable reaction... Not gonna say that I didn’t deserve that, but—”</p>
    <img class="cpuk-talk" src="../talksprites/cpuk/prism.png" style="width:28%;height:28%;margin-left:74%;">

    <p class="ass-text">Daigo lets out a roar from deep within his gut, his eyes wild and rabid, as he attempts to leap at her.<br><br>

        Before he could get the chance to do anything else to her, Tera successfully grapples and holds him back.
    </p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“Daigo, what are you doing?!”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/tera.png">

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“Let me go!!”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="ass-text">The two of them struggle as Daigo flails and grunts himself loose to no avail. In the middle of this flailing,
        he focuses on her, still quaking with rage, just absolutely seething.
    </p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“What in the actual fuck is wrong with you?!”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="cpuk-talk-text">“Daigo, please listen, I’m not—”</p>
    <img class="cpuk-talk" src="../talksprites/cpuk/prism.png" style="width:28%;height:28%;margin-left:74%;">

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“No! You shut the hell up! I don’t wanna hear any of the bullshit coming out of your mouth! You think you
        can just walk in here and try this shit?! After everything you've done?!”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“Daigo, enough! What are you saying?!”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/tera.png">

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“I said let me go! You stay out of this!”</p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“<i>I said that’s enough!!</i>”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/tera.png">

    <p class="ass-text">Tera tosses Daigo around and behind it, as far from Prism as it can manage.<br><br>

        More so out of exhaustion than anything else, Daigo calms himself down by only a little.    
    </p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“Why the hell are you stopping me...?!”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“I’m not going to let you assault our guest host. I know you’re heated, but—”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/tera.png">

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“But what?! We’re just supposed to give her a chance to do whatever she wants?! To fuck with our roster?!
        Or even us?!”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="ass-text">Tera sighs.</p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“Clearly, there’s some context that I am missing from all of this... So I’d appreciate if either of you would
        enlighten me...”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/tera.png">

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“Oh, well, why don’t we let the Girl Scout over here speak for herself?!”</p>

    <p class="cpuk-text">Prism hesitates to look at either of the ASS hosts in the eyes.</p>

    <p class="ass-text">Daigo scoffs with a “tch” as he mutters something under his breath.</p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“<span style="font-size: small;"><i>Of course you won’t...</i></span> Can’t even talk about what you did

    <p class="ass-text"><span style="font-style: normal;">“U-Umm...”</span><br><br>
        
        Suddenly, a new voice cuts through the tension, causing all three hosts to turn towards the door.<br><br>
    
        A human, it seems like, with a little fang over their mouth and little demon horns on their head, peeks through the door leading
        outside.

    <p class="ass-text">Risyra slides out of view from the door and goes off to have fun like their life depended on it.<br><br>
        
        With that out of the way, Daigo gets back to glaring at Prism. Not as rage-fueled as he was seconds ago, but still pretty miffed
        about the whole thing, huffing out a quick sigh before continuing.
    </p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“Alright, now talk. What the hell are you even doing here? What do you want from us?”</p>

    <p class="cpuk-text">Prism takes a deep breath, merely glancing at the ASS hosts before keeping her gaze down again.<br><br>

        There’s a melancholic energy about her now. Her movement is a bit sluggish, her voice is a bit quiet...<br><br>

        There’s even what looks to be sadness in that smile of hers.
    </p>

    <p class="cpuk-talk-text">“I’m...doing a little soul-searching.”</p>
    <img class="cpuk-talk" src="../talksprites/cpuk/prism.png" style="width:28%;height:28%;margin-left:74%;">

    <p class="ass-text">Daigo folds his arms, his face looking quite unamused.</p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“<i>Wooooow</i>, Prism. And here I thought you couldn’t lie, but you just said that you have a soul with
    no trouble at all.</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="ass-text">There’s venom in that sarcastic tone of his.</p>

    <p class="cpuk-text">A heavy sigh.</p>

    <p class="cpuk-talk-text">“I know you’re mad at everything I’ve done and said. Everyone’s mad, and I don’t blame them at all. I’m here
        because I just... I want to know what I should be doing instead of...everything before then.”</p>
    <img class="cpuk-talk" src="../talksprites/cpuk/prism.png" style="width:28%;height:28%;margin-left:74%;">

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“And what’s that got to do with us?”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="cpuk-talk-text">“I’ve plucked fighters from other shows for my own tourneys, but... I never really took the time to think about

        what they do.”</p>
    <img class="cpuk-talk" src="../talksprites/cpuk/prism.png" style="width:28%;height:28%;margin-left:74%;">

    <p class="cpuk-text">Finally, she manages to raise her head and properly look at Daigo and Tera in the eyes.</p>

    <p class="cpuk-talk-text">“So, I decided to see all these fuffles up from close and try to find out why they exist or why the people who
        made them love doing so. Yours included. And I guess...try to make amends with some of them, too, while I’m at it. If I even can... After all,
        a lot of these shows started because of CPUK. Seems only reasonable that a lot of driving forces behind them also wouldn’t have the highest
        opinion of me, as you demonstrated.”</p>

    <p class="cpuk-talk-text">“And that’s the whole reason I came here and helped make the Dream Tourney Festival. I managed to catch you

    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/tera.png">

    <p class="cpuk-text">She nods.</p>

    <img class="cpuk-talk" src="../talksprites/cpuk/prism.png" style="width:28%;height:28%;margin-left:74%;">

    <p class="ass-text">Daigo lets out another quick sigh, a begrudging one.</p>

    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="ass-text">Tera just kind of...stands there for a moment, letting the words soak in.</p>

    <p class="cpuk-talk-text">“I know I’ve done a lot of wrong, Daigo. But you have to understand, I just didn’t want it all to end. I mean,
        think about it, <i>CPU Kerfuffle</i> as we all know it would just cease to exist if there’s no more story to tell. The show itself stopped
        and went on hiatus, and it would just be stuck there for the rest of time, with no closure for anything... And when fear takes hold of you, you
        tend to go to darker places... So I had to keep things going at any cost. Even if it meant hurting others. Even if it meant I had to be the
        villain I was assigned to be.”</p>

    <p class="cpuk-text">She wipes her eyes with a hand, making sure those tears don’t get in the way of anything.</p>

    <p class="cpuk-talk-text">“You don’t have to forgive me. I just want you to know my side of the story and why I’m here, even if I always feel
        this guilt eating away at me...”</p>

    <p class="ass-text">...<br><br>
        
        For a moment, Prism’s whole story gets to Daigo. He kinda gets it. He doesn’t want CPUK to end either. But here we are.<br><br>

        For a moment, Daigo was willing to accept her offer. Let the DTF continue. After all, it did just start. Would be a shame to end it here
        and now.<br><br>

        For a moment, all of his anger, all of his fury and hate, had melted away.

    <p class="ass-text">But it was only for a moment, and not a moment longer.<br><br>
        
        Because the longer her words stewed around in his brain with all those new memories of his, the less he sympathized with her.<br><br>

        He shakes his head to get himself out of that funk.
    </p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“Alright. Okay. Lemme see if I got this. You wanted to keep the narrative going, no matter what. Keep the

        of Death, something he assumed for the entirety of his immortal life. But instead of telling him his true calling right then and there,
        you treated it like a little game, like you’re some kind of riddle master. Despite the fact that you’ve been raising the gods to be
        something that you wanted them to be.”</p>

        even like him. And even after she found a way to keep him safe and the timeline stable, you just went, ‘<i>Oh well, you’re gonna suffer

    <p class="ass-text">He starts marching his way towards her. His voice gets steadily louder with every point mentioned.</p>

        up with them. After <i>you</i> made Dani relive through the trauma of almost losing her arm for what seems to be no fucking reason at all. All

        care about, never letting anyone have any moment of emotional catharsis after all the bullshit you put them through, blackmailing a cosmic entity and
        then revealing extremely personal memories that she didn’t want anyone to know, trying to do whatever the fuck you were planning to do with Light Pit,

        making everyone upset and sad and scared! I don’t even know if you were actually getting some kind of sick enjoyment out of all that! But seeing that goddamn smile on

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“...I’ve never seen you like this before. I’ve seen you angry and frustrated, but never this outwardly hateful
        and hostile.”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/tera.png">

    <p class="ass-text">It had a point. Daigo can’t remember the last time he got this heated over something. Then again, his memory’s
        always been a little faulty... But even still, there’s nothing in recent memory that even came close to making him feel this way.
    </p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“Guess that shows how much Prism sucks. I’m sure the world would be a better place if she were dead in a ditch
        somewhere.”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“...This isn’t like you, Daigo. This isn’t like you at all.”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/tera.png">

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“Not like me?”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="ass-text">He pushes himself off the wall.</p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“You’re one to talk, y’know! All I’m doing is looking out for everyone! But you, you’re being way too...nice
        and forgiving and...!”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="ass-text">He growls, scratching his head with both hands.</p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“I don’t want her hurting anyone here, and I’m not gonna let her! I’m not gonna give her the chance of ever
        fucking with us! The instant we let our guard down, she’ll use whatever fucking trauma we went through in our lives against us just
        because she’s that petty! I’ve already given you all the context you need back there, you know why she sucks! Prism goes, end of discussion!”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“...I understand, then.”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/tera.png">

    <p class="ass-text">It sighs, disappointment in its eyes.</p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“It pains me, but I don’t want to push you into doing something you don’t want. You are just as important to myself
        and <i>All Systems Struggle</i> as everyone else. I was simply...too excited for this tournament to see that, and for that I’m truly sorry. After
        all, an event like this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I figured that, since you are a massive fan of <i>CPU Kerfuffle</i>, you’d be excited
        as well.”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/tera.png">

    <p class="ass-text">And it’s that disappointment that catches Daigo off-guard.</p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“D-Don’t try to guilt-trip—”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“I promise you, I genuinely do not wish to. I’m apologizing. It’s clear Prism has hurt many. However, you ultimately
        have the final say in this.”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/tera.png">

    <p class="ass-text">Tera steps toward the door, heading out, but turning his head towards Daigo as his hand grips onto the handle.</p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“I will leave you to think about it for a bit. You do need to calm down. I’ll go back inside to try and smooth
        things over with Prism. I trust that you will make the right decision.”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/tera.png">

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“...Yeah.”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="ass-text">It opens the door. It goes inside...<br><br>

        And it’s gone.<br><br>

        Leaving Daigo all alone with his thoughts and the muffled sounds of bloodsports close by. 
    </p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“...”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="ass-text">He leans back against the wall again with a deep exhale and a furrowed brow.<br><br>

        Seeing Tera like that, so sad and disheartened... It really...<br><br>

        N-No! He shouldn’t be feeling guilty about any of this! Daigo’s in the right here! He’s right for
        feeling angry! Prism fucking sucks! She should die a miserable death all alone, as far as he’s concerned!<br><br>

        Why should he ever feel sorry for her? Or for what he said? Or for how he made Tera feel?<br><br>

        He’s not sorry at all.<br><br>

        Nope. Absolutely not.<br><br>

        Not in the slightest.<br><br>

        Not one bit.<br><br>

        Not a fraction of guilt here.<br><br>

        ...<br><br>
    </p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“...”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="ass-text">...</p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“<i>...God fucking damnit!</i>”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="ass-text">With a groan, he enters the locker room.<br><br>

        He could see Tera and Prism, already in the middle of some conversation, seated on one of the benches.<br><br>

        And the two notice him.<br><br>

        He looks over at Tera, then at Prism.<br><br>

        He takes a deep breath.<br><br>

        And he sighs.
    </p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“...Fine.”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="cpuk-talk-text">“Hm?”</p>
    <img class="cpuk-talk" src="../talksprites/cpuk/prism.png" style="width:28%;height:28%;margin-left:74%;">

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“You can stay and do your little tournament.”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="cpuk-text">Prism stands up from the bench.</p>

    <p class="cpuk-talk-text">“R-Really...?”</p>
    <img class="cpuk-talk" src="../talksprites/cpuk/prism.png" style="width:28%;height:28%;margin-left:74%;">

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“Only ‘cause something like this comes once in a lifetime.”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="ass-text">His glare intensifies, as he gets face to face to her once again.</p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“But if I catch you doing anything... The literal instant I see you doing anything at all that has to do with
        your story/dream bullshit, I’m beating your ass sideways and ending this shit immediately. I know that I can’t beat you at your full
        strength, but even if that’s true, I’m going to be swinging so goddamn hard, you’ll start seeing fucking shrimp colors.”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“Haven’t ‘shrimp colors’ been disproven already?”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/tera.png">

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“<i>Don’t ruin this for me!</i>”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="ass-text">He says that through gritted teeth, soon to shift his focus back onto Prism.</p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“Are. We. Clear?”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="cpuk-talk-text">“Crystal. No using my powers the way I used to, none of that Dreamer stuff, and certainly no shattering anyone’s
        perception of reality, I promise. Cross my heart, scout’s honor, with hand on heart, and most importantly...”</p>
    <img class="cpuk-talk" src="../talksprites/cpuk/prism.png" style="width:28%;height:28%;margin-left:74%;">

    <p class="cpuk-text">She raises her hand and holds out her little finger.</p>

    <p class="cpuk-talk-text">“Pinkie promise.”</p>
    <img class="cpuk-talk" src="../talksprites/cpuk/prism.png" style="width:28%;height:28%;margin-left:74%;">

    <p class="cpuk-text">And she looks at Daigo expectantly.</p>

    <p class="ass-text">Daigo looks down at the finger, then at Tera, nudging him by nodding its head.<br><br>

        And he groans and rolls his eyes, as he takes his own pinkie and wraps it around Prism’s.
    </p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“Pinkie promise...”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="cpuk-talk-text">“...Thank you, Daigo. It really means a lot.”</p>
    <img class="cpuk-talk" src="../talksprites/cpuk/prism.png" style="width:28%;height:28%;margin-left:74%;">

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“Yeah, don’t think this makes us friends, white woman.”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="ass-text">He pulls the finger away as if he’s worried he might catch something from her.<br><br>

        And then, he could feel a familiar hand on his shoulder as his partner stands beside him.
    </p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“Daigo, thank—”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/tera.png">

    <p class="ass-text">Daigo raises a hand to cut Tera off, pushing its own hand off.</p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“Please don’t. I don’t wanna hear it.”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="ass-text">He looks away from it, a mixture of bashful and annoyance on his expression.</p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“...I’m only doing this for you.”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="ass-text">Despite this, Daigo could certainly tell Tera’s smiling under his mask. A consolation prize for all of this.</p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“Shall we get going, then? We wouldn’t want to miss more of the tournament, right?”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/tera.png">

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“You two go on ahead. I need some time to myself. Cool off, like you said.”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="ass-text">It nods.</p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“Of course. Take as much time as you need.”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/tera.png">

    <p class="cpuk-talk-text">“See ya at the commentator’s booth, Daigo!”</p>
    <img class="cpuk-talk" src="../talksprites/cpuk/prism.png" style="width:28%;height:28%;margin-left:74%;">

    <p class="ass-text">With that, Tera and Prism take their leave.<br><br>
        
        Once again leaving Daigo all by his lonesome.
    </p>

    <p class="ass-talk-text">“...”</p>
    <img class="ass-talk" src="../talksprites/ass/daigo.png">

    <p class="ass-text">Daigo looks down at his right hand.<br><br>

        The one he used to punch Prism with.<br><br>

        The one he used to make that pinkie promise with her.<br><br>

        It still hurts...<br><br>

        And he lowers it back down, letting out another sigh as he looks down at the floor, muttering to no one but himself.
